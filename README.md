Analysis of 25 years of British Library funding data (1998-2023) examining institutional resilience through fiscal austerity. Demonstrates policy impact assessment, financial trend analysis, and organizational adaptation strategies using R and data visualization.

This project analyzes how cultural institutions adapt their funding strategies during prolonged fiscal austerity, using the British Library as a case study. Through comprehensive data analysis of 25 years of funding data (1998-2023), the study reveals that despite recent "recovery," government funding remains 25% below historical peak levels, forcing significant institutional adaptation including revenue diversification and operational changes.
